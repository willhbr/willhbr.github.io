# About

![picture of me looking whistful](/images/me.webp){:class="half-right" style="aspect-ratio: 4/5"}

I'm a software engineer, [photographer]({{ site.urls.photos }}), and computer enthusiast, living in [Sydney, Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney). As long as I can remember I've been taking things apart and then failing to put them back together again.

Most of my favourite projects prompt questions like "what's even the point" or "why did you even think of that", like the time when I [proved that you can run arbitrary code by swapping between tmux windows](/2024/03/15/making-a-compiler-to-prove-tmux-is-turing-complete/), then [wrote a sudoku solver](/2024/12/27/solving-sudoku-with-tmux/), then [played a video with 5,170 tmux windows](/2025/03/17/playing-video-with-5170-tmux-windows/), and finally [implemented Snake with tmux configs](/2025/03/20/snakes-in-a-pane/).

Sometimes I work on normal projects, but they're not interesting enough to get on the about page. You can find a lot of them over on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/willhbr).

I studied Software Engineering at the [University of Canterbury][canterbury], graduating in 2017. Since 2018 I have worked at [Google](https://google.com) Sydney, first as an [SRE](https://sre.google) in database infrastructure, and now on Maps for Android Automotive. This is personal website, if you want my employer's views on things, you'll have to find another website.
