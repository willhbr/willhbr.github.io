title: 'Will Richardson: About Me'
---

I'm Will - a software engineer and photographer from New Zealand, living in Sydney. In 2008 I started programming as a hobby, graduated from the University of Canterbury with a degree in Software Engineering in 2017. Since 2018 I have worked at [Google](https://google.com), as an [SRE](https://sre.google) on database infrastructure, and now on Maps for Android Automotive.

This is entirely my personal blog, its content is solely my personal views, not those of my employer.

Most often I write about my personal projects and areas of computing that I find interesting. You can find the projects that I have published on [Github](https://github.com/willhbr).

Despite appearances, I do venture outside on occasion. For example:
