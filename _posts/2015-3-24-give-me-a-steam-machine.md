At GDC this month Valve announced that they will finally ship the [Steam Controller and Steam Link](http://store.steampowered.com/universe/) later this year, opening up the possibility for third party manufacturers to ship their own Steam Machines with a Steam Controller. This again brought out a multitude of articles questioning who would want a Steam Machine; everyone who wants to game already has a gnarly PC and people that don't want to set up a PC or want to play in their living room have a console. However ,I want one. I don't have a console **or** a serious PC and I think there are plenty of people like me that could consider buying a low-mid range Steam Machine.

In the last year I got into some casual gaming on my laptop, starting with Valve's own classic - Half Life - and then moving on to some GTA, Portal and Half Life 2. Even though these games are well aged, they still manage to push my wee MacBook Air a bit harder than I would like. What would be great is if I had some way of playing any game I wanted (within reason, I wouldn't expect it to be able to push GTA V in VR or something crazy like that) without worrying about compatibility or performance.

Notice the key word I used there: _compatibility_. Buying an XBox One or PS4 today would mean I could play most games realeased in the next decade, but at the moment there are plenty of games I would like to play that are from the previous console generation, or even before that (Far Cry, the original GTA 'trilogy'). For this there is little better than a mid-range PC, and while you've got that why not make your life easier <sup>[citation needed]</sup> and get a Linux based OS that is built for gaming: SteamOS? (Obviously if I wanted to play older games I would have to dual boot Windows, which would take away a lot of the streamlined appeal.)

So while everyone is ragging on Valve for introducing something that they don't want to buy because they can't imagine anyone without a beast of a gaming PC or a shiny new console, I honestly think that if SteamOS is picked up by some decent indie developers it could entice a lot of casual gamers.
