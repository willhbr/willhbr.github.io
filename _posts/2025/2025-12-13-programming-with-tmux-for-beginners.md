Last week I gave a short talk on my adventures doing weird things with tmux. It went well, so I decided to record the slides with voiceover:

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
<iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
  width="650" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Uh2mYl95Z8"
  title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

It's _very_ high level, the code snippets are simplified for readability, and I don't go into much detail on the process of working this all out, but I think it's a nice introduction to the whole project.

Of course you can read more about:

- [Writing the Brainfuck and Python compilers](/2024/03/15/making-a-compiler-to-prove-tmux-is-turing-complete/)
- [Improving the process with key bindings](/2024/03/16/further-adventures-in-tmux-code-evaluation/)
- [The sudoku solver that I didn't have enough time to go into](/2024/12/27/solving-sudoku-with-tmux/)
- [Playing video in tmux](/2025/03/17/playing-video-with-5170-tmux-windows/)
- [Implementing Snake](/2025/03/20/snakes-in-a-pane/)

Then the things I didn't mention are [keeping things inside tmux with `run -C`](/2025/01/10/how-did-i-miss-run-c/) and [unlocking the full speed of tmux](/2025/10/25/full-speed-tmux-interpreter/).

You can watch the talk in the video above, or [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Uh2mYl95Z8).
