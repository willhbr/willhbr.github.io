I just came across [MarkEdit](https://markedit.app/) on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@MarkEditApp/109837635866336116), and then instantly installed it. It's advertised as being "TextEdit, but for Markdown" and it totally delivers on that.

Since I've started using my Mac more for general tinkering (instead of mostly just photos), I have not been able to find a decent no-nonsense Markdown editor. The options that go around seem to be:

- MacDown, an open source split-screen editor which used to work quite well but has [significant issues open for multiple years](https://github.com/MacDownApp/macdown/issues/1104)
- IA Writer, Ulysses, and other "professional" apps. These are no doubt the best and most feature-complete, but for writing stuff here it seems like overkill.
- TextMate/BBEdit/Atom/VS Code/etc. Having declared text editor bankruptcy by moving to Vim, I don't really want to think about these. Plus their main focus isn't going to be Markdown, and they'll come with many more bells/whistles than I need.
- Obsidian. This is what I had ended up using (and even [writing a plugin](https://github.com/willhbr/obsidian-publish-to-jekyll)) to write the file out to my GitHub Pages repo.

MarkEdit is really impressive for a project with an [initial commit only two days ago](https://github.com/MarkEdit-app/MarkEdit/commit/67fe2e847a4870430c28712281555aec0cdef14f) (do people really scrub their version control history before publishing‽).

Since I'm writing this entirely to spread the news of a good app, I thought I'd ask ChatGPT to write a one-paragraph review:
