title: "Learn Enhancer Reaches Version 2.0"
---

When I first started [Learn Enhancer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/learn-enhancer/dnllhgllbbihefjdpamldjnlpllogkcf) at the start of my degree - sometime in early 2014 - it was just a single JavaScript file that would redirect to a certain URL if it found a certain element. Eventually I coughed up the $5 required to submit it to the Chrome Webstore, and it started its slow creep on to students browsers.

This initial version didn't catch every case, and so just over a year later I grew frustrated enough to dig right into the HTTP requests and alter them to ensure that the file could be previewed - which I outlined [on this blog](/2015/06/08/learn-enhancer-16/). Since then I branched out into re-styling every page on Learn with gentler colours (with design supervision from Sarang) - which had the delightful side-effect of letting me see whenever someone has Learn Enhancer installed. It is nice to see my work being used by people that have no clue who I am.

One of the features that I wanted to include but never quite worked out was auto-login, so that I didn't have to two buttons before accessing content on Learn. This never quite worked out, until this morning I saw [Patrick](https://github.com/agronauts) working on a script to do it. Thankfully he was receptive to the idea of incorporating this into Learn Enhancer, and soon he had a it working in the extension.

So here we go, Learn Enhancer has hit 2.0. Since this is my last year at UC, I have put [Learn Enhancer on GitHub](https://codeberg.org/willhbr/learn-enhancer) so that (in theory) current students can contribute fixes when Learn inevitably changes after I have graduated.

If you are a current UC student, download [Learn Enhancer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/learn-enhancer/dnllhgllbbihefjdpamldjnlpllogkcf), you will almost definitely appreciate it.
