Some top tips from [Frederico Viticci's iOS 11 review](￼https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-11-the-macstories-review/):

1. Press CMD-Option-D to show the dock. No more awkwardly trying to reach for the edge of the screen when your keyboard is in the way.
2. Grab the top nubbin in split view to re-arrange the windows in split view.

And some things that I wish were top tips but aren't:

1. Drag and drop apps in the multitasking view to create enter split view.
2. Use CMD & arrow keys to move apps from spotlight into split view.

And some things that aren't mentioned that I would like to see:

1. Some way to enter 50/50 split view immediately, without going into 70/30 first.
2. Open-in-place support in _all the apps_.
