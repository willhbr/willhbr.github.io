I have decided to downgrade my phone. I don't feel the need for a large HD screen, a massive battery, and 3GB of RAM. The extra resolution of the 13MP camera pretty much wasted on me. I have used this phone - the [OnePlus _One_](https://oneplus.net/one) - for the last two and a half years and have decided that when I get a new phone, I no longer need something of this calibre.

When the _One_ came out, it boasted top-of-the-line specs - an incredible 401ppi 5.5" screen, massive 3100 mAh battery, a quad-core 2.4GHz processor, and a 13MP camera.

Almost all new phones in the last few years put the specs of the _One_ to shame - boasting 8-core CPUs, over 6GB of RAM, screen densities upwards of 550ppi, and 16MP cameras.

_So, what to do?_

Thankfully, I found a device that suits my needs a bit better. The screen is a respectable 326ppi, the battery just 1800 mAh, only 2GB of RAM, and a 12MP camera.

This device does incur the cost of running a less common operating system that is proprietary to this particular manufacturer, rather than using Android, the de-facto industry standard. I have used Android for a long time, so this did weigh heavily in my decision to move, but in the end I decided that the more modest, lower-specced device was the right choice.

The phone arrived last week and even though the specs are behind even my _One_ from 2014, thankfully I haven't noticed any lack of performance or responsiveness in day-to-day use. Even with its battery that is less than two thirds the size the the _One_'s, I still haven't dropped below 30% at the end of the day.

So, long story short - I got an iPhone 8 and it's _amazing_.
