Last month I spent some time in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) and discovered a new appreciation for phone photography. My Sony a6500 did make the trip with me (along with standard compliment of lenses, filters, and suchlike) but I ended up taking a lot of photos on my phone, and being really happy with the results.

The phone in question is my iPhone 15 Pro, that I bought at release last year. Like with my previous two iPhones (an 8 and a 12 Pro) I always felt that the photos it took were _good_, but not something that I would take time to edit significantly to achieve a look much different from how it arrives out of the processing pipeline.

The first day in Paris was grey and drizzling with rain. I carried my a6500 with me, but I'm not super comfortable using it in the rain as while the camera body is weather-sealed, the Sony 18-105mm lens is not. This has never been a problem—I've got it damp plenty of times before—but I don't know what the limit is. The result was that I took a lot more photos on my phone that I might have otherwise. Any modern phone is basically completely waterproof. With no articulating screen, interchangeable lens, knobs or dials, I have no concerns about using my phone even in a complete downpour.

A phone form-factor has a bunch of advantages to even a moderately compact dedicated camera. I think the biggest is the social/psychological advantage: taking photos on a phone is much more normal than using a dedicated camera. Someone taking a photo on their phone basically just blends into the background, whereas someone using a dedicated camera with a big lens is clearly doing _photography_ which is treated differently by other people. I always try to make it clear that I'm taking photos of _things_, not the people around them, and that I'm happy to wait until there's a clear moment to get my shot—so please just keep doing what you're doing and don't worry about where you're standing. I've thankfully never had anyone confront me while I'm taking photos, but I'm socially awkward enough to try and avoid any confrontation preemptively.

During these rainy days I took lots of pictures of the Parisian architecture and edited them in [Photomator](https://www.pixelmator.com/photomator/) right on my phone. I'm not a big user of presets, but because of the overcast skies and uniformity in the colours of the buildings in Paris, after editing a few photos I stopped copy-pasting the same edits and just made a preset called "Paris". This would accentuate the colour of the limestone buildings, add contrast to the sky, and push the colours of the foliage more towards an autumnal tone.

While the "camera you have with you" maxim is a bit boring, it is true. Even if I had my a6500 with me—in my bag or on a strap—it is often more convenient to just use my phone. Taking a photo from a bus, train, or cramped cablecar is just easier when you can already have your phone in your hand. This is even easier with the "action button" on the iPhone 15. It means I can be launching the camera _while_ I'm still taking the phone out of my pocket. By the time the phone is pointed where I need it, the camera is already open and ready to capture. Launching the camera from the lock screen software button is incredibly fiddly in comparison.[^android-lock]

[^android-lock]: Android's "double-click the lock button" to launch the camera is similarly convenient, it's a shame that was never an option on iOS.

iOS 18 added the ability to customise the buttons on the lock screen, so I can swap out the shortcut to the built-in camera app to instead open [Halide](https://halide.cam). Originally I did use both Halide and the built-in camera app, depending on the shot. However after editing photos from both apps, I ended up just using the built-in camera, since it's more responsive and I didn't notice a difference in editability.

The most frustrating thing about the action button is the fact that it could be used to do so much more, but it's currently limited to a single action. Right now it is activated by a semi-long press, but you could easily imagine having different actions for a double press, short press, or even short press followed by a long press. Having two different actions could allow for using the button for quick camera access _and_ doing the various interesting productivity whatsits that people have devised. As it stands, I don't want to lose quick access to the camera so reassigning the button is a non-starter.

I was pleasantly surprised that the preset that I had made for buildings in Paris during overcast weather also applied quite well to completely different scenes.

# Phone Photography Tips

## Ensure the sky is exposed correctly

While HDR can save you a lot of the time, it's worth checking—even on an overcast day—that the sky isn't blown out. It's probably the easiest tell for phone photography to have a corner of pure-white sky. This was especially relevant when taking pictures in small streets with just a little bit of sky visible at the top of frame. The phone will expose for the buildings, and leave the sky blown out. If you just tap on the section of sky, you'll probably find that you can get both exposed well, and then just bump up the shadows and bring down the highlights later.

Sometimes the dynamic range is just too much for the phone, in which case just take the photo anyway, but then reconsider your framing and take some alternatives that don't push it as much. Maybe the first one will be recoverable, but maybe you'll end up with a better exposed shot even if it's not the composition you wanted originally.

![a photo of an alleyway in Marseille where the sky could be blown out if you're not careful](https://photography.willhbr.net/photos/2024-11-09-49d938.jpeg){:loading="lazy"}

For photos like this your phone will often expose for the street, and over-expose the patch of sky.

## Look out for over-saturated highlights

I'm not sure of the exact cause of this, but this happens with my phone much more than it happens with my a6500 or my drone. If you take a picture of a well-lit subject (like a beautiful pastel-coloured building in Provence) and then go to play with the colours a bit, you can get weird-looking highlights that are almost clipping in a certain colour. Things usually get less saturated as they get brighter, so you probably just need to desaturate the offending colour channel slightly.

## Don't shoot into the sun

Because of the lower dynamic range, I find that it's just not worth it to compose a shot that includes the sun in the frame. That is unless you're willing to edit it stylistically so that the sky is completely blown out. With a dedicated camera like my a6500 I can play with the exposure enough to get a somewhat pleasant falloff without banding. The best examples I can find from my a6500 are [this shot at Bronte](https://photography.willhbr.net/2021-12-20/), [this shot in Adelaide](https://photography.willhbr.net/2023-02-16/) or [this shot in Tokyo](https://photography.willhbr.net/2023-12-05/) that all include a fairly bright sky that I was able to recover.

## Use the volume buttons to capture photos

If you're this far into a phone photography blog post I assume you already know that you can use the volume buttons to capture a shot, instead of just using the on-screen button. This is useful if you've only got one hand free—the other hand busy with a half-eaten pain au chocolat—and want to take a quick snap. You can definitely contort your hand to press the on-screen button, but that's a great way to drop your phone.

A side-tip is to use the action button to launch the camera, so you can launch the camera app and capture a photo with one hand.

## Consider which lens to use

This will depend on which model of phone you have, so it's worth looking up some info on the different lenses your phone has—and possibly the different faux-lenses that it emulates. For my 15 Pro I have:

### Ultrawide (13mm)

This uses a dedicated 13mm-equivalent lens, which isn't as high quality as the others. I only use it when I need the wider field-of-view. Motion blur is less noticeable with wide-angle lenses, so you can get some good results in lower light with the ultra wide.

### Main/wide lens (24mm, 28mm, 35mm, 48mm)

The biggest advantage of the main lens is that it's got a larger sensor, wider aperture, and more megapixels than the other two cameras. It's a nice default, but I find that too many shots at this "kinda-wide" angle just gets a bit boring. Since the sensor and aperture are the biggest, this is the best to use in low light.

There are the 3 additional fake "lenses" that just crop the 48MP image from the 24mm camera: 28mm, 35mm, and 48mm. The image quality from these goes downhill as the crop increases, but they provide enough of a different perspective that I think they're worth using. I would find myself using the 35mm and 48mm zooms fairly often, to get closer to that "neutral" 50mm zoom. This is often just enough zoom to hide some pesky tourists, cars, or signage just out of frame.

I would recommend taking photos with all four of these zoom levels and paying attention to the difference in the level of detail. In [these two photos from Montserrat](https://photography.willhbr.net/2024-11-15/) the first (of the sun on the hills below) is taken at the 48mm zoom, and when you zoom in you can see far less detail than the second shot of the monastery. (I heavily compress the images on that website, so you'll have to believe me or take some photos yourself).

### Telephoto (77mm)

The 3x "telephoto" zoom is in a bit of an awkward spot. It's not really telephoto enough to give a substantially different perspective, and when it does give one the optics are lower quality enough that the photos are just _fine_. A 77mm camera with the sensor size and aperture of the iPhone's main camera would be great for portraits to get more of a natural bokeh. Perhaps the 120mm lens on the iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPhones 16 Pro will be more exciting for me.

## Use the pre-defined lenses and faux lenses

I call out these focal lengths specifically because I only ever swap between these zoom levels. I act like I'm swapping between physical prime lenses, instead of zooming in and out by pinching. This is fuelled by an obsession to avoid the possibility of zooming to 23mm and taking a dreadful cropped image from the 13mm lens instead of just zooming in a little more and using the much better 24mm lens.

If you're an aspiring photographer it's also useful to get familiar with what field of view you get at each focal length[^35mm-equiv] so when you pick up a dedicated camera you already have a feeling of what it'll see before you turn it on.

[^35mm-equiv]: On a full-frame sensor, that is.

## Don't use portrait mode

I know that everyone loves portrait mode, and it's got so much better than when it was first introduced, but the cookie-cutter edges around people's heads or un-blurred sections in the gap of someone's arm just stick out to me immediately. If you do shoot portrait mode, take the time to just tone down the background blur a _touch_. If you're taking a photo of someone with frizzy or wispy hair, it's probably best to just turn it off.

## Use Photomator's "select sky"

When the sky is overcast and cloudy, I often cheat and use the ["select sky" feature][select-sky] in Photomator to create an adjustment layer only touching the sky. I then lower the exposure and crank up the clarity and texture to accentuate the contrast in the clouds.

![a photo of a building in Paris with a very moody sky](https://photography.willhbr.net/photos/2024-10-26-78d2b2.jpeg){:loading="lazy"}

It's easy to get this over-dramatic crunchy sky look with a little bit of ML and a cranked texture slider.
