I just bought a new (second-hand) TV—upgrading from my 42" 1080p second-hand TV to the latest 55" 4K second-hand TV[^new-tv]—and I can't get over the volume control. This is what it looks like:

[^new-tv]: It's a Samsung TU-8000, if you're interested. It replaces some random Panasonic TV that I've had for years.

The TV was cheap because of the panel defect around the edge.

It appears on the left edge of the screen, and is vertically centred. The green bar shows the fraction of maximum volume, the output device is labelled, and the current volume is shown as a number between 0 and 100.

While writing this I am reminded that Windows 10 (and possibly 11 as well) [increases the volume in multiples of 2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20170321-00/?p=95795) when you use the volume keys, which would drive me up the wall because if your scale only needs 50 points of points of precision, why are you putting it on a scale with 100 points? It seems like you _can_ set it to odd numbers if you use a control other than the volume keys. Either way I still prefer the non-numbered volume control on MacOS and iOS.

Anyway, back to my TV. As well as showing the current volume (in the photo above the current volume is **9**), there are numbers above and below the main volume box. These represent the next step up and down on the volume scale.

One might assume that when you pressed the volume up or down the numbers would animate up or down, as though you are rotating a physical wheel with numbers printed around the rim, viewed through a window that shows three digits, similar to the odometer on a car.

To my absolute horror, this is not the case. Upon pressing the volume buttons, the numbers instantly jump either up or down with absolutely no animation. The two additional digits don't provide any kind of skeuomorphic representation of a volume control, instead they just serve as a reminder of the preceding and succeeding volume levels, in case you forgot that 10 comes after 9.

I understand the desire to have some kind of numbering system so that users can gauge the volume without having to first play audio. You want to be able to set the TV to an appropriate volume level for the surroundings before you play something so you don't miss something or deafen your neighbours. On this TV I already know that having the volume between 10 and 20 is fine for my quiet apartment, but ultimately it'll depend on what I'm playing.

If I were to redesign this, I would make the bar indicator much larger—perhaps reaching all the way across the bottom of the screen—and leave the number and output device in the bottom corner. Hopefully with a much wider bar indicator, the filled portion would be obvious enough that the numbers could be removed entirely.

Of course if I could only make one change, I would remove the preceding and succeeding numbers.
