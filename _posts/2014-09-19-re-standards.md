So I got a bit off-topic in my last post about standards, and how I think we need more of them to make all the cool new gadgets _function_ together - maybe not work nicely, but at least function.

So naturally, I've been thinking about what I'd like to see standardised.

### 1. Wireless file transfers

Airdrop is pretty cool, so is Samsung's S beam. Both are limited to a handful of devices (S beam is actually based on the standard android beam, but is extended to tranfer faster over an ad-hoc wifi network)

Sending a file to someone shouldn't be difficult, but at the moment you're stuck with email, a physical drive or a cloud storage ([relevant xkcd](http://xkcd.com/949/)). Being able to share a file to any device without cables or 3rd party apps would be excellent.

At the moment the easiest way to transfer a file to my phone from my laptop is either Dropbox or a home server. Neither are particularly convenient - I think most android phones should have a 'USB mode' and can act like a pen drive, hovever my last two phones and tablet couldn't do this (all Samsung - correlation?)

### 2. Cloud storage (& other web services)

So, everything's moving towards the cloud. You can pick up a Chromebook for a few hundred dollars and cast away ties to any local filesystems. However, your data has to be in Google's servers. Hmm. Any app that you use either needs it's own server or use Google's.

I would be great if basic cloud save functionality was standardised, so that you could pick the service that data is stored in, decreasing the monopoly that Google will only get a tighter grip on _when_ (not if) Chromebooks take off. This could mean that for some app, when you sign up you just say "put my data in ACME Cloud Storage, please!" and away it went, without the app developer having to hard-code interfaces for every cloud provider on earth.

This idea _could_ be extended to social networks and other web apps, similarly to how android handles intents - if you have a network 'installed', you can share information to it from any other webapp. Again without the developer having to write tedious amounts of code.

### 3. Instant Messaging

Similar to #2 this would mean that different services would have at least some kind of common functionality - I don't know.. like messaging people or something - and then each provider could have more **awesome** features on top, but at least you wouldn't absolutely have to have multiple services just to talk to people. Imagine if email only worked between the same host? Gmail would be the only one left (I mean, who uses anything else?)

I don't know quite how any of this would be implemented, but that's another problem!
